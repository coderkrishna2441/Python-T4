'''
There is an array of scores of 5 Batsmen in 4 T20 Matches. Which is given below.
Scores= [[13, 10, 9, 33], 
[63, 46, 90, 42], 
[39, 76, 13, 29], 
[82, 9, 29, 78], 
[67, 61, 59, 36]]
Further you are asked to perform below tasks. 
(i). Add scores of every batsman of 5th Match given below in the same array and print the array.
Match_6= [41, 87, 72, 36, 92]
(ii). Add two new batsmen’s scores in respective 5 T20 Matches in the array created in task (i) above and print the array.
Batsman_6= [77, 83, 98, 95, 89]
Batsman_7= [92, 71, 52, 61, 53]
(iii). Add extra column with sum of all 5 T20 Matches’ scores of each batsman in the array created in task (ii) and print the 
final array.
Note: Use Numpy module for all the Arrays given above
Using the final array created in task(iii) above, generate graphs mentioned below:
(a). Make a line chart of Total Scores of each batsman which is stored in last column of final array v/s No. of Batsman. Use 
dashed line in graph, with black color. Give label on x-axis as “No. of Batsman” and label on y-axis as “Scores”. Give title to 
the chart as “Leader Board” with bold fonts.
(b). Make one Bar chart of scores of Batsman_1 and Batsman_2 for all 5 T20 matches. Give color for bars of Batsman_1 as 
Purple and for Batsman_2 Dark red. Also show required legend in bar chart.
(c). Make a pie chart of Total Scores of each batsman which is stored in last column of final array. Show the pie chart with 
exploded view of all pieces with 0.1 amount. Also display percentage in the pie chart. Also show required legend for pie 
chart.
Note: Passing the values using numpy Array Slicing from array created in task(iii) for creating graphs above is compulsory.
