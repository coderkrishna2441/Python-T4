Jeff is a branch manager at a local bank. Recently Jeffâ€™s is receiving customer feedback saying that the wait times for a client 
to be served by a customer service representative are too long. Jeff decides to observe and write down the time spent by 
each customer on waiting. Here are his findings from observing and writing down the wait times spent by 20 customers (in 
seconds): 43.1, 35.6, 37.6,36.5,45.3,43.5,40.3,50.2,47.3,31.2,42.2,45.5,30.3,31.4,35.6,45.2,54.1,45.6,36.5,43.1.
Plot a histogram for the above data.
