'''
Write a program to build 6 graphs(3 row and 2 column) using subplot function for given data:
Subplot 1:
Draw a line from (5,5) to (10,17) to (25,25) to (60,40) to (80,30) with suitable label in the x axis, y axis and a title.
Line color should be green.
Line style should be dotted.
Marker should be diamond.
Subplot 2:
Write a Python program to create bar plot of scores by group and gender. Give suitable label in the x axis, y axis and a title. 
Colors of all label should be black and title should be bold. Color of bar plot of men and women scores should be green and 
red.
Data:
Scores_men = (22, 30, 35, 35, 26)
Scores_women = (25, 32, 30, 35, 29)
Subplot 3:
Write a Python programming to create a pie chart with a title of the popularity of Car company. Make multiple wedges of 
the pie. Also show the percentage.
data:
Car : Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Honda
Popularity: 25,50,30,20,35
Subplot 4:

students. Marker of mathematics and science should be circle and star. Colors of marker of mathematics and science should 
be yellow and blue.
Test Data:
math_marks = [88, 92, 80, 89, 100, 80, 60, 100, 80, 34]
science_marks = [35, 79, 79, 48, 100, 88, 32, 45, 20, 30]
Subplot 5:
Write a Python programming to display a horizontal bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages. Colors of all 
programming Languages should be different. Give suitable label in the x axis, y axis and a title.
data:
Programming languages: Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, C, C++
Popularity: 20,100,25,30,45,50
Subplot 6:
