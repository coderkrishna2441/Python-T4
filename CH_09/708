Write a python program to create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class.
In Vehicle class vehicle name, mileage and seatingcapacity as its data member. The default fare charge of any vehicle is 
seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total 
fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
Sample Output:
The bus seating capacity is 50. so, the final fare amount should be 5000+500=5500.
The car seating capacity is 5. so, the final fare amount should be 500
