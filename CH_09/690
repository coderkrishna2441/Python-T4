Create a class called Student, having name and email as its data members and _init_(self, name, email) and putdata(self) as 
bound methods. The _init_ function should assign the values passed as parameters to the requisite variables. The putdata 
function should display the data of the student. Create another class called PhDguide having name, email, and students as 
its data members. Here, the students variable is the list of students under the guide. The PhDguide class should have four 
bound methods: _init_, putdata, add, and remove. The _init_ method should initialize the variables, the putdata should 
show the data of the guide, include the list of students, the add method should add a student to the list of students of the 
guide and the remove function should remove the student (if the student exists in the list of students of that guide) from 
the list of students.
